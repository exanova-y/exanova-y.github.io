At UWaterloo ERABLab, we worked on building a neural network that recognizes gestures of a haptic hand and controls the motion of many brushbots with Professor Gennaro Notomista. This involved learning linear algebra, some multivariable calculus, neural networks, the PyTorch framework and ROS. There was a more-than-expected amount of troubleshooting.
