These were completed around spring 2020 during lockdown.


**Procrastinator simulator:** A text game where you try to finish a task list but each time a dice determines the duration you take (cursed LOL) by Yoyo "a thousand projects" Yuan. Test it out [here](https://replit.com/@exanova/ProcrastinatorSimulator#main.py)!

**Mining Away:** [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) implemented as a [game](https://github.com/exanova-y/hs-projects/blob/master/procrastinator-simulator.py) of mining bitcoins while avoiding lava.   

**Acacia Tree:** Acacia during sunset, python art. [video](https://youtu.be/jLRcKHBvJMs?si=YKtDxWQuW-JwCXcS)

**Shooting basketball:** See the demo [here](https://youtu.be/3lpbydHhxCI?si=aE2mp9j6gv-ZnW7E)
