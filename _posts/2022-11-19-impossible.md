According to a popular meme, university students must choose between sleep, studying, and socializing. I adapted it into a moving graph consisting of sleep, studying, and extracurriculars coded in processing java. The code combines geometry with behavioral research. As part of the assignment to practice coding techniques, I coded the graph without using any libraries. This project is collected into the best grade 12 OOP design projects of all time out of a few hundred projects.
