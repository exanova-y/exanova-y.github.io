Billions of people donâ€™t have access to an MRI scan due to high costs. Ultrasound brain imaging has a similar spatial resolution to MRI (millimetres, better than other non-invasive modalities) and is 100x cheaper. We will demonstrate ultrasound neuroimaging in simulation, which previously has only been done in an academic setting with private code. We are also open-sourcing our project to encourage development in a hardware context. Collecting neuro data at scale, a main bottleneck will speed up neuroscience as a whole. This project will move us towards a world where brain-related disorders are universally detected or treated. Currently, we have received funding from hack grants and emergent ventures.
