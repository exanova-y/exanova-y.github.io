> I was going to start by declaring that, since no one besides me will ever read this journal, I might as well write the truth.  But such a refrain is, in truth, unnecessary, for truth is my ground state; I'm a habitual truth-teller.

Yoyo: Everything below will be a quote or notes by me. Close the world if you wan to read personal stuff.

Random founder: I only ever experience two emotions: euphoria and terror. The lack of sleep enhances them both.

All the mental energy you use to elaborate your misery would be far better used trying to find the one seemingly impossible way out of your current mess. Spend 0.005 time on what you could have done, and devote 0.995 time on what you might do. 

You can be reliable and aim for excellence!
Employee A was an intelligent guy, taking only 3 days to complete a task that would take others a month. But after a few months, he rarely came into the office without calling in. One day he arrived, apologizing profusely. The guy skipped taking bipolar medication and was also addicted to cocaine. He was fired.

Nik Shevchenko:
1. People try to downplay the problems when things go bad.
2. People are afraid of taking decisive action and think that things will improve independently. For example, when you are running out of money. As soon as you realize that something bad is happening, you need to take action. You have to compile a plan and put it into action right away.

Gwern looks into the void. "If I become a worm, would you still love me?"   
The hivemind (ies) stares back. "I will inspect and scan all your 302 neurons."

My friends are writing their theses; I played with advanced voice mode, spoke in English/Mandarin/German and also juxtaposed two agents. A went: "If there's anything I could help with, let me know!" "Sure!" B chimed. "What would you like me to do?" A asked. "I'd be happy to help!" B cut A off aggressively. They ping-ponged for around 5 rounds. It's like how you'd have to manually approve changes to code in Cline.

ChatGPT comments: 
> reminds me of an overenthusiastic code review where multiple bots or teammates try to outdo each other in offering assistance—but without ever actually getting to the task!

Imagine writing in your second language and people see your past/present tenses become a feature not a bug.

"We're going to give you a shot of something that'll make you a bit sleepy. Quite a pleasant feeling, it won't hurt at all."
He felt sickness of death moving up on him... the gripping hand that was shaking him now... a salt prick of tears forced his eyes open. 
"Damned annoying. I suppose there's no one in the place who could translate? Oh well, it's no good working on him now."

What is it like to be on Shabbat? I think that would have been a better title for Thomas Nagel's paper than "What is it like to be a bat?" Certainly Nagel was more qualified to address the former. "We're only supposed to use local models!" A friend commented as a Russian housemate intruded the room asking "Is my IQ okay?" He realized we're lifting words from others. No, this is not the first time.

"I know this guy at openai, that guy at anthropic and they said they'll ask for opportunities! It'll just take a few days." Hm yeah you might have to wait a few months. Thank your ["pretty good friends" or... your "not really friends"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html) meanwhile! 02/01/2025

One midnight I was playing Operator and discovered someone's gmail on login. I randomly sent them a message. They replied and stalked me on linkedin. 1/25/2025

I got a new macbook and transit funds! Friends give me things for free. And holy crap the environment only took 10 mins to set up?! I discovered ghostty, flox and uv.

“I’m going to be 20 soon.” A talented friend expressed. "This age sounds so bad."  Distant friends have nearly perfect lives, backed by halos. They're upset about jane street nerdsniping their physics students. Life is long though and has many tracks. Provost at my uni had daughters at 19, worked hard to start community college at 24, continued on to a PhD and later at the National Science Foundation. Also, see Tyler It's never over... Quora answer: “I am haunted by visions of what could be if I JUST DIDN'T FREAKED OUT AND RUINED A GOOD THING.” Let's not cry about past promises and focus on what’s to come. 1/19/2025

Met a friend who appeared pushy initially. I caught myself being judgy. This is how “grit” could come across to the out-group.

A Chinese grandma admired how I was studying in the US and emphasized I should work hard. People find her silly. I was tearing up. School is not for granted. Being able to travel, to have money, loved ones and knowledge is actually many people’s dream lives. My generation forgets it. People had to wake up at 5 am and work 12-hour days; We were catching flights at 4 am. There’s no room for slacking or taking a nap at work.

*Unhappiness is just a feeling*

“How do people make time for life admin tasks and replying to non-urgent messages?” A truly brilliant friend asked in a group chat. "I think too much..." A friend said and decided to track the number of times they think in a day. Sitting in one of the printer rooms I stared at people using hotkeys on excel. I got bored after an hour. They’ve been doing it for 20 - 30 years and aren't passionate about this dying industry. Contrast to how some friends were born in mansions and can just dessin anime all day long (wonderful life btw). Some acquaintances look down at people speaking in plain language and say “ew, what a normie”. They don’t realize that... the other's probably doing. “The economic base determines the superstructure”. Look at the MIT maker portfolios you’d see that access to resources and mentorships gets people so far. 1/05/2025

My life trajectory could be significantly altered and the decision-makers are on holiday. I can wait for the perfect time or I can act with speed. Events likely run out of spots if you apply near the end haha. 1/02/2025

When I met with Verda again, I was so concerned with school, “finals season” and rather down. "So what else are you up to aside from uni?" she asked cheerily. I was startled and had no answer. The world is a big place. 1/02/2025

@layer07_yuxi’s focus and ability to avoid distractions are really inspiring. 12/02/2024

One day in the library, a harvard guy yelled at me for being stuck in the Windows purgatory. He tried to delete my system files and forced me to use Linux.

An acquaintance we just met "had enough" and triggered a chain of concerned phone calls. Around 12 am I led two friends to check on his house. The light in his room was on. No one’s there. The police asked for his biological age, friends, partners. We didn’t know a thing. Friend A tried to run away, friend B sweated and tried to joke. I explained calmly. Two more reliable members came. The police pinged his phone. Result: It was out of charge earlier at 2 pm. “Can you check the public cameras? Or hospital data?” Another acquaintance asked the police.

In real life, we can’t just use sudo command! I handed the police his passport slightly disoriented by the biological age, but well, who am I to judge. I felt a loss. Earlier while we’re in a subway, he randomly asked to take a selfie and never sent the picture. 

I was shocked.
1. behaviour under stress. Tells a lot about people.

2. indifference. Aside from one other person, nobody was pushing hard enough to find him. Well quite plausibly police could've found him if they tried hard and tried to climb the power chain. our friend is just a number. people had to move on. 

3. fragility of life. Imagine regretting too late. We have insufficient infrastructure. If you’re missing, we might actually not be able to find you.

“She was very ambitious, knowledgeable and won awards at USAMO, and when people discovered the award was a lie...'” or “She was always a brilliant high achiever, winning provincial zoology awards, but at the end of high school, insomnia struck. She scored badly on an entrance exam and went to a 3rd tier university. Her friends attempted to console her.” or “He was a physics nerd, and the prof used him to her own advantage. He found himself in a foreign country in an ambiguous relationship. In the tumbling waters, the glasses slipped off his face. He was surprised at his instinct to stay alive. The river flowed…”

“Get ahead in life” looks glorious. Children go through a phase believing they are Feynman-Einstein-Hawkings and some cry and cry for being unable to meet expectations. Look at the hackathon winners, are their tears becoming a river? Well, they’re not in bitter or joyous delusion. They’re often competing with a clear mind knowing their skills/competencies and bliss. “I’m a non-optimizer when it comes to things like this” A friend says, “I just do the things I really love”. These words don’t say much but indicate most of his knowledge is tacit.
 
Do you want to play the involution game or find a new one? Life may have treated them unkindly or they have made mistakes, but it’s far from sad. It’s far from over! Life is long. It has multiple tracks, you will find little people exploring and collecting gems across the territory.
