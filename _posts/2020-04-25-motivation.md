"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our speaker from the latest trending startup!" A guy walked on to the stage.

“Two years ago, I lived in a crowded slum and only had $20 in my bank account. I was chronically depressed, unmotivated and lonely. However, one evening changed everything. At that moment, I was crying about the meaningless of life on the balcony. All of a sudden, our senior neighbour screamed at me and warned: “Our building is on fire, get out now!" My tears disappeared as I saw him pour water onto the fire, proceeding to shake violently and fell. It was an electrical fire!

I felt pity for the old man and his lack of physics knowledge. From that moment, I decided to master everything about physics. I purchased all of the physics textbooks. Money didn't matter, because I stole the books and into mephistopheles I become. 

I study for 16 hours daily on a polyphasic sleep schedule and ate only bread. My neighbours' kids would squawk at me for being such a loner and self-absorbed. But I, with messianic determination, ignored them.

After a year, the kids revered me like a god. I was nominated for the impressive context, and I achieved 1st place in the city. **But I am NOT satisfied!** With the $3000 prize money, I could buy food, video games and help my parents with their farm. Instead, I bought a plane ticket to Boston.

I snuck up into an MIT lecture room, walked up to a lecturer and told him outright he was wrong. He was shaking his head and loudly disagreeing as I delivered a proof on the blackboard. The students were so enthralled that they started throwing **physics textbooks** in the air, from condensed matter physics to quantum mechanics. After class, he admitted that I was right!

He revered me so much that I became his lab assistant. Without finishing high school, I was soon nominated as a PhD candidate and an employee of the MIT Media lab! Haha, I blogged, while some losers have spent 16 years in high school, I am only 16 years old when I entered, my age glorifies me, defines me. I told him, within 3 months, I will solve world hunger, cancer and all the biggest problems through gaining enough capital. He was in denial, but that’s just the pessimism of the experts. 

The professor was waiting forever and forever for grant money, so I took a break and launched two startups in the meanwhile.

That day, I took a picture of me and set it as my phone background. If this is what a typical teenager can do in two years, what can you?

The motivational speaker stepped off the stage, chugging a can of energy drink and popped a pill into his mouth. "Sleep is for the weak." He said.He suddenly had a heart attack and passed away.
