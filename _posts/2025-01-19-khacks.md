Two-day hackathon at K-scale labs as the team were iterating with robots, and encountered a variety of set backs. Nonetheless, the humanoid robot could imitate simple human poses (e.g. from T-pose to A-pose). We used tensorflow js + corresponded the transition with robotic arm movement with the help of flask and other python scripts. Teams encountered a variety of setbacks and practiced troubleshooting skills for software and hardware.
